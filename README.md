# BudgetTracker
This is an Android budget tracking app for a project at school.

So far, only a basic tab layout with 3 tabs are implemented. 
The 3 tabs are Spending, Receipts, and History.

The Spending tab has text fields to enter expense names and their respective dollar amounts.

The Receipts tab has an image of a receipt. I want to be able to use the camera within the app and store any pictures it takes here.

The History tab has text fields like the Spending tab. I want to be able to show previously entered expenses by month.
